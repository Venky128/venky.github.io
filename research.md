My work in the industry has focused on applying  machine learning methods to problems involving automation, pattern recognition and predictive modeling. In addition, I have worked on more general optimization problems, building simulation systems from scratch,  devising novel algorithms and designing experiments and intervention strategies. 

I draw on significant experience and expertise in varied topics such as statistical physics, information theory, numerical simulations, opitmization, predictive modeling, etc. and  approach problems from a unique perspective. 

Part of my earlier academic work focused on unraveling the structure and dynamics of biological phenomena. A broad goal is identification of robust underlying structure and interactions of systems that are consistent with a large variety of data. This requires the application of statistical methods coupled with other inferential approaches such as modeling and simulation.

My PhD. research was studying steady states of nonequilibrium systems and specifically microscopic models of heat conduction. 

[comment]:<> The challenges involved here are disentangling direct and indirect dependency, determining potential causality and latent variable confounders. The specific problems I worked on included reverse engineering of networks using information theory and other methods, developing dynamical models for immune system and central nervous system to understand mechanism of development and progression of multiple scleroris, studying disease co-occurrence on a network and leveraging the network-based approaches to arrive at putative causal associations between them.      


[comment]:<> Interpretation of results from quantitative analysis can often be tricky in the case of biological systems. Well-known issues include the problems of p-values, bias in measurements and estimations, numerical and computational errors, incommensurability of variables, and breakdown of key assumptions. To identify these issues, and to reduce their effects, it is critical to understand the methodology in full detail, particularly the results obtained when applied to nonstandard data sets. My work has explored the bias originating in measures of association and effect in contingency tables in the context of disease networks. In a different case, the observation of strong association between biomarkers from flow/mass cytometry was explained by postulating existence of hidden variables, somewhat analogous to the Simpson paradox.

[comment]:<> Such issues need to be addressed in a case by case manner. The key step is to check that the implications of analysis are reasonable, use methods like bootstrapping to determine if the results are consistent and stable, and design appropriate controls or null distributions as the case may be.
