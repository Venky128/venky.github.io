I am interested in topics relating to freedom, openness and equality in the social, political and cultural realms. Here are some links to various resources/organizations that I find to be doing some good stuff in different areas. 

### **Internet**

1. [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/): When it comes to issues of internet freedom, censorship, encryption, and hacking, EFF is pretty indispensable resource.
2. [Internet Freedom Foundation](https://internetfreedom.in/) : IFF working towards fighting censorship, internet shutdowns, authoritarian laws and defending privacy, digital freedom, open access, net neutrality among others in India.      
3. [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/) : With a network of volunteer nodes, Tor re-routes internet traffic across multiple relays, and together with layered encryption ensures anonymity and privacy. Here is a really [cool visualization](http://torflow.uncharted.software/) of the Tor network.
4.  [Gnu Privacy Guard](https://gnupg.org/): A free implementation of the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), a suite of tools involving asymmetric key cryptography that is used to send and receive data securely and digitally sign messages. It can even be added to an email client like Thunderbird.
 


### **Animal Rights**

[A curated resource sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Sy6WnyFNnqrqs8yG1l_2q8qNc7WCAcmVWG2AblwWlg/) on the subject that covers everything from ethics and environmental issues together with the nutritional aspects of plant-based diets and the intersection of animal and human rights issues.   

1.  [NonHumanRights Project](https://www.nonhumanrights.org/): The existing legal status of animals do not afford them much protection from abuse and animal welfare laws are often too weak and lack proper enforcement. NhRP aims to change the status quo by working towards greater recognition of nonhuman animals as legal ''persons'' and extending certain fundamental rights towards them. In the [now famous case](https://www.wired.com/2013/12/chimpanzee-personhood-nonhuman-right/), they represented two chimpanzees Tommy and Kiko that were held in captivity arguing for their release through writ of habaes corpus, the centuries old common law injunction against unlawful detention. Although the decision of the New York appelate court was negative, it led to a [remarkable opinion from the judge that is worth reading in full](http://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/Decisions/2018/May18/M2018-268opn18-Decision.pdf). 
2.  [Bengaluru Brigade For Animal Liberation](https://www.facebook.com/BengaluruBrigadeForAnimalLiberation/): BBAL is a very active and a rapidly growing presence in Bangalore.  BBAL organizes outreach activities, marches, participation in fairs and community events, delivers lectures in schools and colleges and is involved in rescue efforts. I am personally involved with some of their activities.
3. [Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organization](https://www.fiapo.org/): FIAPO is perhaps the largest organization in India working towards greater rights, protections and welfare for (especially farmed) animals in the country.
4.  [Animal Charity Evaluators](https://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/): ACE carries out systematic research into the effectiveness of various approaches used by animal charities. Their evaluations and assessments are more thorough and extensive than most I've seen. The work of ACE can be seen as an extension of the principles of Effecitve Altruism (see below) to the animal advocacy movement.

### **Effective Altriusm** 

Effective altruism aims to follow an evidence based approach towards identifying the best ways to do good in the world. This not only includes evaluating specific projects but also examines career choices and identification of the most important gloabl problems.  

1. [80000 hours](https://80000hours.org/): They primarily focus on career suggestions for anyone who is motivated to help solve address some of the pressing  problems facing the world. This includes everything from [policy work to AI safety research](https://80000hours.org/articles/high-impact-careers/). They have a [podcast series](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/) that features fairly long (not less than an hour and typically more) and rather detailed discussion on topics ranging from voting system to catastropic risk and artificial intelligence.
2. [Open Philanthrophy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org): Organization involved in identifying philanthrophic opportunitiees and making grants towards them and following that up with results. 
3. [GiveWell](https://givewell.org): GiveWell perhaps were one of the first non-profits to emphasize effective altriusm focusing on stuyding the actual impact of charity interventions and actions.
[comment]<>  (2) The Intercept: Consistently brilliant investigative journalism into issues ranging from surveillance, state repression, censorship and corruption.
