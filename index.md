I am a data scientist with a background in physics, applied maths and computational biology. I have experience working on a range of inter-disciplinary problems both in academia and in the industry. I am drawn to the fascinating and often under-explored overlap in the quantitative appraoches and tools used to study various fields. 

I am currently  with Flipkart, and not long before that, Amazon and Swiggy. Prior to that, I had completed my PhD. in theoretical physics from Rutgers University followed by a postdoc in systems and computational biology at Karolinska Institute. I did my undergraduate (an integrated MSc., to be precise), also majoring in physics, at IIT Kanpur.   


Aside from work, I enjoy running (max so far: 31k), hiking, photography (if you see someone with a DSLR and 300mm lens on a hike, come say hello :P) and  coffee (personal brew: [Aeropress](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/aeropress)).
