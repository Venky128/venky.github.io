I am a data scientist with a background in physics, applied maths and computational biology. My experience covers a wide range of problems both in academia and industry, often drawing on methods and ideas from multiple disciplines. I am fascinated by how clear quantitative tools have proven to be  universally powerful in identifying patterns enabling predictions and developing strategies across an ever-increasing array of fields.


I work at Flipkart, and before that, at Amazon and Swiggy. Prior to the industry, I did my PhD. in theoretical physics from Rutgers University followed by a postdoc in systems and computational biology at Karolinska Institute. I did my undergraduate (an integrated MSc., to be precise), also majoring in physics, at IIT Kanpur.   


I blog on topics related to data science and statistics at [Valid Inference](https://statsanddata.wordpress.com/).


Aside from work, I enjoy distance running (max so far: 31k), hiking, photography (carry my DSLR with extra lenses on long hikes!) and  coffee (personal brew: [Aeropress](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/aeropress)).
